# Qubit Modeling Tools (QMT)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Microsoft/qmt.svg?token=p3pgk1RGEpy1Q9Un18aT&branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/Microsoft/qmt)

Welcome to our qubit modeling tools (qmt)! This package is designed to automate
the setup of complex geometries appropriate to physical qubit simulations. This 
package is licensed with an MIT open source license.

A significant part of the repository consists of Python functions and macros to
be executed within FreeCAD, either interactively or in batch mode. These
require the latest stable version of FreeCAD (0.16).

Required Python packages:
* numpy
* scipy
* sympy
* matplotlib
* mpi4py
* pytest
